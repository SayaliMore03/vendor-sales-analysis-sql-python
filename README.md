#  Vendor Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing vendor sales data using **Python** and **MySQL** to derive meaningful insights.  
The workflow includes an automated **data ingestion pipeline with logging**, structured **data exploration in Jupyter Notebook**, and an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for business decision-making.

##  Project Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Python script to load raw data into MySQL.
   - Logging implemented for tracking ingestion and preprocessing steps.
   

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducted in **Jupyter Notebook** using SQL queries and Python.
   - Analyzed vendor performance, sales trends, and product-level insights.
   - Visualized patterns with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

3. **Insights**
   - Achieved $441M in Sales with $134M Gross Profit and an avg. profit margin of 38.7%.  
   - Top vendors (e.g., Diageo North America, Martignetti, Pernod Ricard) contribute the majority of sales.  
   - Several vendors and brands are low performing, impacting profitability.  
   - Purchase Contribution % highlights vendor dependency risks.  
   - Identified opportunities to optimize unsold capital (2.71M).  
   - Seasonal and category-wise trends suggest where growth strategies can be applied.

4. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize key KPIs:  
     - **Total Sales, Total Purchase, Gross Profit, Profit Margin, Unsold Capital**  
   - Vendor Insights:  
     - **Top Performing Vendors** by sales contribution.  
     - **Low Performing Vendors** and their sales impact.  
   - Brand Analysis:  
     - Scatter plot showing **sales vs profit margin**.  
   - Purchase Contribution:  
     - Donut chart breakdown of vendor contribution %.  
   - Helps stakeholders quickly identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.
